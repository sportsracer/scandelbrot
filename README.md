# Scandelbrot

Visualize the Mandelbrot set. A toy project I used to teach myself some Scala.

![Scandelbrot example visualization](doc/scandelbrot.gif)

## Usage

* Requires `sbt`. Start program with `sbt run`.
* Click anywhere in the image to zoom in, click right to zoom out.
* Hit _space_ to toggle different colorization methods.
* Press _enter_ to save a screenshot of the current view in higher resolution.

## Development

### Lint & run tests

```
# Reformat main source files and tests
sbt scandelbrot/scalafmt scandelbrot/Test/scalafmt

# Run tests
sbt test
```

### Overview of files

* [`Complex`](src/main/scala/Complex.scala) models a complex number including some arithmetic operations
* The [`MandelbrotSet`](src/main/scala/MandelbrotSet.scala) singleton tests whether a complex number is contained within the Mandelbrot set
* [`MandelbrotRenderer`](src/main/scala/MandelbrotRenderer.scala) renders the Mandelbrot set and its surroundings onto an image, using a [`Colorizer`](src/main/scala/Colorizer.scala) to color pixels based on escape time
* â€¦ and in [`Main`](src/main/scala/Main.scala), we create the [`MandelbrotViewer`](src/main/scala/MandelbrotViewer.scala) window where all this is visualized
